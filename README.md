Chronofilm is an interactive web game where users must place movies in chronological order based on their release year. Players are shown a trailer for a movie and must decide if the next movieâ€™s trailer belongs before, after, or in between the movies already placed on the timeline. The game involves building a timeline with 10 movies in the correct order across 20 rounds.
